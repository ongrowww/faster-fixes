# Faster Fixes

A widget that lets a website's end-users report bugs and feedback in-page; reports flow into a project inbox, can be mirrored to external trackers (GitHub Issues, Linear, Jira), and announced to notification channels (Slack).

## Language

### Reporting

**Feedback**:
A bug report or comment submitted via the widget on a customer's site. The atomic unit of the inbox.
_Avoid_: Issue (reserved for tracker-side artifacts), Ticket, Bug report.

**Reviewer**:
The end-user of the customer's site who submitted a Feedback through the widget.
_Avoid_: Reporter, Submitter, User.

**Review Image**:
An image uploaded by a Reviewer for visual review. A Review Image belongs to one Project and contains regular Feedback pinned to locations on the image.
_Avoid_: Attachment (too broad), Screenshot (reserved for a Feedback capture).

**Project**:
A Faster Fixes container scoped to one website (one widget install). Holds Feedback, settings, and at most one **Project link** per **Integration**.
_Avoid_: Site, App, Workspace.

**Widget**:
The in-page reporting UI a Reviewer uses to submit and browse Feedback on a customer's site. One Widget per Project, whatever the **Embed** it was installed through.
_Avoid_: Plugin, SDK, Snippet (the install code of an Embed, not the Widget itself).

**Embed**:
A way of installing the **Widget** on a site: the **script embed** (a script tag, no build step) or a **framework embed** (a package for one rendering runtime: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte). A framework embed exists per runtime, never per meta-framework: a Nuxt site installs the Vue embed, an Analog site installs the Angular embed, a SvelteKit site installs the Svelte embed, a Next.js or Remix site installs the React embed. Every Embed exposes the same customization and behaviour; an Embed changes how the Widget is installed, never what it does.
_Avoid_: Integration (reserved for external systems), Adapter, Wrapper (implementation vocabulary).

### Identity & access

**Project public ID**:
The public, unguessable identifier for a Project (`proj_` + 96-bit random), embedded in the widget so submissions route to the right Project inbox. Public by design — it carries no secret and is safe to ship in client code.
_Avoid_: API key (the widget surface has no secret key), Client secret.

**Allowed origins**:
The web origins a Project's widget may call the API from: the Project's registered **domain** plus any **subdomain** of it, and localhost for local development. Matched against the browser-set `Origin` — the real security boundary for widget requests. Deliberately **not** a free-form domain allowlist: a Project is one website and `projects` is the billed unit, so letting one Project span unrelated domains would bypass per-website pricing.

**Reviewer token**:
The per-Reviewer secret that authorizes reading and submitting Feedback. Created in the dashboard, delivered to a Reviewer via URL param or localStorage. This — not the Project public ID — is the gate on Feedback access.

**Agent token**:
The organization-scoped secret (`ff_agent_`) for the agent/MCP API. The only genuine secret credential in the system; stored hashed and revocable.

### Account & billing

**User**:
A person with a Faster Fixes account who signs in to the dashboard. Distinct from a **Reviewer**, who has no account.
_Avoid_: Account (a credential record of the sign-in subsystem), Customer.

**Auth**:
The sign-in subsystem: credentials, sessions, email verification, password reset, impersonation. Owns no business entity; it establishes which **User** is acting.
_Avoid_: Login, Identity.

**Organization**:
The tenant. Owns Projects, Installations, Agent tokens and the Subscription. Every User acts within one active Organization.
_Avoid_: Team, Workspace, Company.

**Member**:
A User's belonging to an Organization, carrying a **Role**. One per (User × Organization).

**Role**:
A Member's permission level: `owner`, `admin`, `member`. Write "member role" in full when the role is meant; bare "Member" is the entity.

**Invitation**:
A pending offer for an email address to become a Member of an Organization, with a Role. Accepted or rejected by the recipient.

**Subscription**:
An Organization's billing relationship, mirrored from Stripe. At most one active per Organization. Belongs to the Organization, never to a User.

**Plan**:
The tier a Subscription grants (`free`, `pro`, `agency`), defining limits (projects, members) and feature access. An Organization without an active Subscription is on the free Plan; a self-hosted instance always resolves to the top Plan.

**Paying organization**:
An Organization whose Subscription is `active` or `past_due` in Stripe. Trialing, unpaid, paused and incomplete Subscriptions do not count. The unit for MRR, conversion and churn.
_Avoid_: Customer, Subscriber, Paying user (billing belongs to the Organization, never to a User).

**Engaged organization**:
An Organization that received at least one Feedback in the last 30 days, meaning its Widget is installed and used by Reviewers. The unit for usage and adoption metrics.
_Avoid_: Active organization (reserved for the Organization selected in a User's session), Active user.

### Feedback lifecycle

**Status**:
The state of a Feedback. Canonical values: `new`, `in_progress`, `resolved`, `archived`.

**Status actor**:
Who or what drove a Status change: a **User**, a Tracker sync, or the **Agent** (an Agent-token caller). Travels on the status-change event so a **Notification channel** can distinguish an agent-resolved Feedback from a human-resolved one.

**Archived**:
A Feedback the team has decided not to act on (won't fix, duplicate, out of scope). Stored in the database as `status = "closed"` for legacy reasons; the literal will be renamed in a future migration. UI label is **Archived** everywhere (status dropdown, kanban action, archive view).
_Avoid_: Closed, Dismissed, Rejected.

### Integrations

**Integration**:
An external system Faster Fixes connects to through an **Installation**. Comes in two categories: a **Tracker** (two-way mirror) or a **Notification channel** (one-way announce). Currently GitHub Issues, Linear, Jira and Slack.
_Avoid_: Connector, Plugin, External system.

**Tracker**:
A category of **Integration**: an external issue-tracking system Faster Fixes can mirror Feedback into, converging its state with the Feedback's. Currently GitHub Issues, Linear and Jira. The category is defined by the mirroring behaviour, not by the product type.
_Avoid_: Integration target, Sink.

**Notification channel**:
A category of **Integration** where Faster Fixes _announces_ Feedback one-way, holding no mirror and creating no Issue. First instance: Slack. Distinct from a **Tracker** (two-way, mirrors Feedback as an Issue and converges its state). Not to be confused with a Slack _channel_ (the specific room a Project posts into).
_Avoid_: Webhook (implementation detail), Sink.

**Installation**:
The org-level connection to an **Integration** — a **Tracker** (`GitHubInstallation`, `LinearInstallation`, `JiraInstallation`) or a **Notification channel** (`SlackInstallation`). One per (Organization × Integration).

**Reconnect required**:
The state of an **Installation** whose authorization the **Integration** has explicitly refused or revoked. Only a User re-authorizing the connection clears it. A transient failure of the Integration never puts an Installation in this state.
_Avoid_: Disconnected (an Organization with no Installation at all), Broken, Expired.

**Jira site**:
The Jira Cloud instance an Organization connects to (e.g. `acme.atlassian.net`), identified by an Atlassian `cloudId`. The org-level scope of a Jira Installation — the analog of a Linear workspace or a GitHub account. One per Organization.
_Avoid_: Jira instance, Jira workspace.

**Jira project**:
A project inside a Jira site (e.g. `PAY`). The per-Project tracker scope a Faster Fixes Project links to — the analog of a GitHub repo or a Linear team. Always written "Jira project" in full; bare "project" means a Faster Fixes Project.

**Project link**:
The project-level binding from a Faster Fixes Project to an external scope — a Tracker scope (a GitHub repo, a Linear team) or a Notification channel destination (a Slack channel). One per (Project × Integration).

**Issue link**:
The per-Feedback record connecting a single Feedback to its mirrored issue in a Tracker. A Feedback can have at most one issue link per Tracker, but may have one for each Tracker simultaneously.

### Diagnostics

**Diagnostic Trail**:
The console and network history captured leading up to a Feedback submission, attached to that Feedback to aid reproduction.
_Avoid_: Session, Logs, Recording (the Trail is a bounded snapshot, not a continuous session recording).

**Console Entry**:
One captured `console.*` call: level (`log`/`info`/`warn`/`error`/`debug`), message, timestamp. All levels captured.

**Network Entry**:
One captured `fetch`/`XHR` call: method, URL, status, duration, timestamp. Metadata only — request/response bodies are not captured in v1.

**Ring Buffer**:
The fixed-size in-memory store the Widget fills from page load; oldest entries drop when full. A Diagnostic Trail is a snapshot of this buffer at submission time.

## Relationships

- An **Organization** has many **Members**, owns many **Projects**, and has zero or one active **Subscription**
- A **User** may be a **Member** of several **Organizations**, with one **Role** in each
- A **Feedback** has zero or one **Diagnostic Trail**
- A **Diagnostic Trail** contains many **Console Entries** and many **Network Entries**
- The **Widget** maintains one **Ring Buffer** per page session; submitting Feedback snapshots it into a **Diagnostic Trail**
- An **Integration** is either a **Tracker** or a **Notification channel**
- A **Project** has many **Review Images**; each Review Image references one **Asset**
- A **Feedback** belongs either to a website page or to one **Review Image**
- A **Project** has zero or one **Project link** per **Integration**
- A **Feedback** has zero or one **Issue link** per **Tracker**
- A **Reviewer** submits **Feedback** through the **Widget**; Reviewers are not authenticated app users
- A **Widget** is installed through exactly one **Embed**; Embeds differ in install mechanism only, never in behaviour or customization
- An **Installation** is owned by an Organization and shared across all Projects in that Organization
- The same **Feedback** may exist as a GitHub Issue and a Linear Issue at the same time; both are mirrors of the Feedback, not peers of each other
- A **Notification channel** (Slack) receives one-way announcements of a Feedback; unlike a **Tracker** it holds no mirror, has no **Issue link**, and never feeds state back to the Feedback

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "When a Reviewer submits a Feedback, do we create the GitHub Issue immediately?"
> **Domain expert:** "Only if the Project has an active GitHub Project link with auto-create enabled. Same for Linear, independently — a Project can mirror to neither, one, or both Trackers."
>
> **Dev:** "What if the team marks the Feedback as Archived?"
> **Domain expert:** "On the GitHub side it closes the Issue with `state_reason = not_planned`. On Linear it moves to a `canceled`-type state. The Feedback is the source of truth — Trackers are mirrors and must converge to it."

## Flagged ambiguities

- **"Closed" vs "Archived"** — historically used interchangeably. Resolved: the canonical user-facing term is **Archived**. The DB literal `"closed"` is retained for now to avoid a migration; rename is deferred.
- **"Issue"** — refers exclusively to a tracker-side artifact (GitHub Issue, Linear Issue). Internal app records are **Feedback**, never "issues".
- **"logs"** — used loosely for the captured browser data. Resolved: the canonical term is **Diagnostic Trail** (console + network), distinct from server-side logs.
- **"Integration" vs "external system"**: the glossary said "external system" while the UI and the team said "integration". Resolved: **Integration** is the canonical umbrella term; **Tracker** and **Notification channel** are its two categories, and **Installation** and **Project link** apply to both.
- **"API key"** — the widget historically embedded an `apiKey` stored like a secret (SHA-256 hash, last-4 shown, "regenerate" flow). Resolved: the widget surface has **no secret**. It embeds the public **Project public ID**, secured by the **allowed origins** (domain + subdomains) + **Reviewer token**. Genuine secrets exist only on the agent surface (**Agent token**). The widget `apiKey` is being removed.
