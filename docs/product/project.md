# Project Overview

This project is a developer-focused tool designed to simplify the process of collecting and handling client feedback on web applications.

## Problem

During the **review / QA phase of a project**, clients often send feedback in messy ways:

- Long WhatsApp or Slack messages
- Multiple screenshots without context
- Bullet lists of issues
- Vague UI/UX comments
- No link to the exact page or element

Developers then have to:

1. Understand the feedback
2. Find the correct page
3. Reproduce the issue
4. Rephrase it as a technical task
5. Create a ticket
6. Implement the fix

This creates **friction, lost time, and mental overhead**.

## Solution

This application simplifies the workflow between **clients and developers**.

It provides:

1. **A website widget** that allows clients to click anywhere on the page and leave feedback.
2. **Automatic context capture**, including:
   - Screenshot
   - Page URL
   - Browser metadata
   - DOM selector and element description
   - React component tree (when available)
   - Timestamp
3. **A developer dashboard** where feedback is collected and organized.
4. **Agent-ready markdown export** — each feedback item can be copied as a structured markdown bug report, ready to paste into an AI coding agent like Claude Code.
5. **Issue tracker integrations** — feedback can sync to GitHub and Linear as issues, with bidirectional status sync (see Integrations below).

The key idea is to transform:

> **messy client feedback → agent-ready bug report → AI-assisted fix**

## Developer Workflow

The product is designed for **developer-first workflows** with two paths to consume feedback:

### Manual workflow (dashboard)

1. A client leaves feedback directly on the website via the widget.
2. The system captures the full context (screenshot, URL, selector, component tree, browser info).
3. The developer opens the dashboard and copies the feedback as structured markdown.
4. The developer pastes the markdown into an AI coding agent (e.g., Claude Code).
5. The agent locates the relevant code and fixes the issue.

### MCP workflow (terminal-native)

1. A client leaves feedback via the widget.
2. The developer asks their AI coding agent to check for new feedback — the agent calls the Faster Fixes MCP server directly.
3. The MCP returns structured markdown with all context (page URL, component tree, source file, selector, screenshot).
4. The agent reads the feedback, locates the relevant code, and fixes the issue.
5. The agent marks the feedback as resolved via the MCP.

The developer never leaves their terminal. The MCP server (`@fasterfixes/mcp`) can be installed on any agent harness that supports the Model Context Protocol — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or others. It connects to the Faster Fixes API using an organization-scoped agent token and exposes two tools: `list_feedbacks` and `update_feedback_status`.

Because the MCP exposes a standard tool interface, it also enables automation. For example, a developer could set up a Claude Code scheduled task that runs daily, fetches all new feedback, fixes the issues, and opens pull requests — fully unattended.

Both workflows produce the same structured markdown report with sections for location (URL, component path, source file, DOM selector), the user's comment, environment details, and a screenshot — everything an AI agent needs to understand and address the feedback without further context.

The goal is to reduce the gap between:

> **client comment → AI agent retrieves and fixes → done**

## Integrations

Feedback can be connected to external issue trackers so it lives where teams already work. Both integrations support **bidirectional status sync** — a status change in Faster Fixes propagates to the linked issue, and closing/reopening the issue in the tracker updates the feedback. Faster Fixes is the canonical source of truth, and a change originating in one tracker is propagated to the other. Issue creation can be automatic (on feedback submission) or manual from the inbox. Created issues carry the full context (comment, page URL, selector, browser/OS info, viewport, screenshot link).

### GitHub

- **Auth**: GitHub App (installation-based), org-level.
- **Faster Fixes → GitHub**: `resolved` closes the issue (`completed`), `closed` closes it (`not_planned`), `new`/`in_progress` reopens it.
- **GitHub → Faster Fixes**: issue closed → `resolved`, issue reopened → `in_progress`.
- Webhooks are HMAC-SHA256 verified; a short sync window (`lastSyncSource`/`lastSyncAt`) prevents echo loops.

### Linear

- **Auth**: OAuth 2.0, workspace-wide; issues are attributed to the app (survives member departures). Tokens stored encrypted (AES-256-GCM).
- **Faster Fixes → Linear**: status maps to Linear state _types_ (`completed`/`canceled`/`started`/`unstarted`), not names, so custom workflows work.
- **Linear → Faster Fixes**: state type drives feedback status (`completed` → `resolved`, `canceled` → `closed`, `started` → `in_progress`, others → `new`).
- Per-team default state, labels, and priority are configurable, with health tracking when configured states/labels go stale.

## Target Users

Primary users are:

- Freelance developers
- Small web agencies
- Teams building SaaS or web applications

Typical stack:

- React
- Next.js
- Node.js
- Vercel
- GitHub
- Linear / Jira / Notion

Their clients are usually **non-technical stakeholders**.

## Design Philosophy

The product follows these principles:

- **Developer-first**
- **Simple for non-technical clients**
- **Minimal friction**
- **Agent-ready output**
- **No AI magic in the product itself** — the AI is the developer's coding agent, not a feature of this tool

It should feel closer to a **developer tool** than a heavy project management system.

## Future Possibilities

In the future, the system could evolve to include:

- **AI-powered task transformation** — summarizing feedback, clarifying vague comments, categorizing issues (bug, UI tweak, content change)
- **More integrations** — extending beyond the current GitHub and Linear sync to other issue trackers (e.g. Jira) and outbound webhooks
- **Autonomous workflows** — end-to-end pipelines where feedback automatically triggers an AI coding agent to produce a fix and open a pull request
- **Agent Skills** — shipping a TanStack Intent skill with the npm widget package so agents automatically learn the Faster Fixes workflow when the widget is installed
