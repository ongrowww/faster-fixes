# App folder architecture: domains, buckets, public APIs

The `src/app/` tree was organised around a root `_features/` folder whose direct children were really domain groupings and whose grandchildren were the actual features. Two implicit tiers, one name. We rename the root folder to `_domains/`, formalise one bucket set inside each domain and mirror it at the route level, and require cross-domain access to go through a per-domain `index.ts` public API. Every file gets an unambiguous home, and the "domains should not import each other's internals" intuition becomes a lint rule.

## Decisions

- **Root `_features/` becomes `_domains/`.** Its direct children are domain folders named after canonical terms of the project glossary. "Feature" now means a capability slice inside a scope.
- **Domains live inside the App Router tree**, at `src/app/_domains/`, not in a sibling `src/domains/`. One tree, one mental model: routes compose domains, and the same buckets serve both.
- **One bucket set at both tiers** (domain and route segment):
  - `_features/`: capability slices (client or server UI tied to one capability, plus its container hooks). Never nested, and at most one grouping level deep (see the amendment below).
  - `_components/`: pure UI bound to this scope, no schema, no server.
  - `_services/`: the data/IO layer, verb-prefixed, transport-agnostic, lazy.
  - `_helpers/`: pure behavioral functions only, lazy.
  - `_types/`: standalone shared isomorphic types, lazy.
  - `trpc-router.ts`: thin tRPC transport at the scope root. Not a bucket; one per scope; optional.
- **`_components/` is flat.** One file per component. Never a folder named after a single component. Variants, skeletons, and compound pieces are siblings. The only subfolders are sub-libraries grouping many distinct components, themselves flat.
- **Routes mirror domains exactly.** No other `_*` folders at the route level.
- **Domain versus route:** if it operates on a domain entity and could plausibly be reused on another page touching that entity, it goes to `_domains/<x>/`. Otherwise (composition, layout, page-specific orchestration) it goes to the route.
- **Promotion rule:** when a route feature gains a second consumer in a different route, move the whole feature to `_domains/<x>/_features/`. Do not extract a shared subset.
- **Cross-domain access goes through `index.ts`.** Every domain exposes a public surface via its barrel. Other domains may only import that path. Routes and `app/api/` are the composition layer and may reach into internals. Enforced by ESLint.
- **The barrel exports capabilities, not server implementations.** UI components, Zod schemas, domain types, parsers, pure helpers, and type-only re-exports from `_services/` belong in it. Service functions and routers do not. When another domain seems to need a server implementation: wrap the data in a server component and expose that; or move the operation to the domain that owns it; or lift the abstraction to `src/server/` or a package. A second "server barrel" is rejected: it codifies the leak.
- **No cross-domain cycles.** Soft hierarchy hint: low-level domains should not depend on high-level ones. The cycle ban is hard; the hierarchy is a review signal.
- **Root `_components/`, `_hooks/`, `_providers/`, `_constants/` are domain-agnostic** because they are candidates for extraction into shared packages. Anything carrying domain knowledge cannot live there.
- **Root `src/server/` is cross-cutting infrastructure only.** Domain-specific server code lives in the relevant scope's `_services/`.

## Considered Options

- **Keep one undifferentiated `_features/` folder.** Rejected: the tree already had two tiers, and pretending otherwise left "is this a domain or a feature?" unanswerable for every new folder.
- **A `src/domains/` tree beside `src/app/`.** Rejected: doubles the top-level surface and forces the same ambiguity for every folder.
- **Strict no-cross-domain imports.** Rejected: real dependencies exist and event-based decoupling is heavy ceremony at this scale.
- **Barrel enforcement by convention only.** Rejected: the convention already existed and was already broken. Lint makes the public surface a forcing function for naming reuse points.
- **Rename route-level `_features/` to `_sections/`.** Rejected: only some route features are layout sections; mirroring the domain buckets keeps one model.
- **More buckets (`_hooks/`, `_constants/` per domain).** Rejected: sprawl for marginal clarity. Hooks live in their feature; constants are helpers or types.
- **Eagerly create every bucket in every domain.** Rejected: most domains need only some. Buckets are created when real code of that kind exists.

## Consequences

- One mechanical migration: `_features/` to `_domains/`, with every import path rewritten.
- A new ESLint rule restricts cross-domain imports to the barrel. Existing reach-ins become lint errors and need a one-off pass: export the contract, or refactor.
- Route folders carrying `_queries/` or other non-bucket siblings become non-compliant. Their contents fold into the bucket that owns them.
- Some old feature leaves are pure presentational components. They move to `_components/`.
- One-time flatten pass on `_components/` wrapper folders.
- The inside of `_services/` (naming, verb vocabulary, transport agnosticism) is specified by the server file conventions ADR, which amends the bucket set described here.

## Amendment: one grouping level under `_features/`

Recorded 2026-09-20. `_features/` holds capability folders, and some scopes group several
related capabilities under a shared area (`(authenticated)/_features/sidebar/organization/`,
`settings/_features/jira/link-project/`). That grouping level is part of the convention and
`no-feature-nesting` now enforces its limit (the depth only: the single-file bullet below is prose,
since the rule does not count the files in a folder):

- A file sits at most at `_features/<area>/<capability>/`. Two non-underscore folder segments
  before the file, no more. A third capability folder is a report: flatten it, or promote the
  inner capability to a sibling feature.
- **A single-file feature sits directly in the features folder**, at `_features/<name>.tsx`. It
  does not need a folder of its own until it has more than one file.
- Underscore-prefixed folders are buckets, not capabilities, so they are free and do not count
  toward that depth. A second `_features/` segment anywhere in the path is still a nested
  feature and is still reported.

One folder breached the limit when the rule landed
(`(authenticated)/_features/sidebar/project/create/`) and was flattened into its parent
capability folder.

## Amendment: domain capability folders sit at the domain root

Recorded at the close of the migration, 2026-09-19. The bucket set above puts a capability
slice under `<scope>/_features/<name>/` at both tiers. In practice the migration left six domain
capability folders at the **domain root** instead, with no `_features/` bucket in any domain:

- `auth/send-verification-email-button/`, `auth/stop-impersonate-button/`
- `subscription/plan-card/`, `subscription/plan-gate/`, `subscription/upgrade-subscription/`
- `project/active-project/`

Route scopes are unaffected and keep `_features/`. `no-feature-nesting` does not catch the
difference, so nothing enforces the choice either way, and every scope-level rule (one
capability per folder, UI plus its container hook, no nesting) already holds as written.

This is an accepted deviation, not an oversight, and the decision behind it is still open:
either the domains gain a `_features/` bucket and the six folders move, or this ADR is amended
again to make the domain-root shape the convention. Until then a new domain capability follows
the existing tree rather than creating the seventh exception in a new place. The same holds for
the promotion rule above: a route feature promoted to a domain lands as a capability folder at the
domain root, `_domains/<x>/<capability>/`, not under a domain `_features/`.

A hook read by more than one feature **inside one scope** is promoted to a capability folder of
its own on that second consumer (`subscription/plan-gate/`, `inbox/_features/feedback-mutations/`)
and barrel-exported when the scope is a domain. That trigger is intra-scope and distinct from
the cross-route promotion rule, which moves a whole route feature into a domain.
