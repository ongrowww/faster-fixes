# Changelog

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#214](https://github.com/manucoffin/faster-fixes/pull/214) [`3e86fca`](https://github.com/manucoffin/faster-fixes/commit/3e86fcaea1d1e984aa0276182c190ee479ff9c65) Thanks [@manucoffin](https://github.com/manucoffin)! - Add `createFakeWidget` under the `@fasterfixes/widget/testing` subpath: a Widget double for testing code that drives the Widget, such as a framework Embed. It records the arguments of every call in `calls`, `emit(patch)` updates `isVisible`, `feedbackItems` or `showPins` and notifies subscribers, and `listenerCount` reports the live listeners. It depends on no test runner. The subpath is unstable, like `@fasterfixes/widget/internal`: it may change in any release.

### Patch Changes

- [#214](https://github.com/manucoffin/faster-fixes/pull/214) [`195b1aa`](https://github.com/manucoffin/faster-fixes/commit/195b1aaa084b64b741b092805e7d6f2450847e25) Thanks [@manucoffin](https://github.com/manucoffin)! - Keep the Reviewer token out of the URL when a router puts it back. `init` removes the `ff_token` query parameter, but a router that finishes its first navigation afterwards, such as Vue Router, wrote back the URL it read at load. The token then stayed in the address bar, was saved in the page URL of new Feedback, and hid the pins of the current page. The Widget now removes the parameter again whenever it reappears, and keeps the router's history state.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#199](https://github.com/manucoffin/faster-fixes/pull/199) [`9d43ac2`](https://github.com/manucoffin/faster-fixes/commit/9d43ac25e4435ea0b86d245fc9ecd9965c1f3b02) Thanks [@manucoffin](https://github.com/manucoffin)! - Add `subscribe(listener)` to the Widget instance returned by `init` and by `createWidget` from `@fasterfixes/widget/internal`. The listener is called after `isVisible`, `feedbackItems` or `showPins` changes, and not when a value is set to what it already was. `subscribe` returns a function that removes the listener, and `destroy()` removes every listener. Use it to keep your own UI in sync with the Widget without polling.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#197](https://github.com/manucoffin/faster-fixes/pull/197) [`576f72b`](https://github.com/manucoffin/faster-fixes/commit/576f72be552ee809aff126e94ad980ae03fdaf28) Thanks [@manucoffin](https://github.com/manucoffin)! - First release. `@fasterfixes/widget` installs the FasterFixes Widget on any website with no framework and no build step: paste one `<script>` tag pointing at `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fasterfixes/widget@1/dist/widget.iife.js` with `data-project-id`, and optionally `data-color`, `data-position`, `data-api-origin` and `data-capture-diagnostics`. Leave out `data-project-id` to call `window.FasterFixes.init(options)` yourself with the full option object, including `labels`. With a bundler, `import { init } from "@fasterfixes/widget"`. The instance exposes `show()`, `hide()`, `isVisible`, `startAnnotation()`, `feedbackItems`, `togglePins()`, `showPins` and `destroy()`, matching `useFeedback` in `@fasterfixes/react`. The Widget renders inside a Shadow DOM, is themed with `--ff-*` CSS custom properties and `::part()`, and ships no framework runtime. The version starts at 1.0.0 so the `@1` CDN channel never has to change.
