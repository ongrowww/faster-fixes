# Error display conventions

How errors surface to the user. Implements `docs/adr/0012-domain-errors-and-transport-mapping.md`.

> **What exists today.** Everything below is live since migration step 4, with one exception:
> `@/server/errors/` holds `domain-errors`, `http-response` (`domainErrorResponse`) and
> `non-retriable` (`rethrowDomainErrorsAsNonRetriable`), but no `next-interrupts`. The
> `interruptOnDomainError` helper is deferred until a page actually calls a service that throws;
> until then, use the preferred `find-` plus `notFound()` pattern.

Errors travel from a service throw, through a transport boundary, to one of four client display channels. Services throw `DomainError` subclasses (`NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`, `BadRequestError`, `ForbiddenError`, `PreconditionFailedError`) from `@/server/errors/domain-errors`; each boundary maps the code to its transport. Unexpected (non-`DomainError`) failures are masked as `Something went wrong. Please try again.` and logged server-side with their `cause` chain.

A second-level subclass of one of the five is allowed when a caller has to tell cases apart, and then carries its own fields and its own copy: the three expected Jira failures (`JiraNotConnectedError`, `JiraReauthRequiredError`, `JiraIssueConfigurationError` in `@/app/_domains/integration/_services/jira/jira-errors`) extend `PreconditionFailedError`, so `instanceof` discriminates them while the transported code stays `PRECONDITION_FAILED`. The five _codes_ remain a closed set: a new code amends ADR 0012.

Client code never imports `@/server/errors/*` and never relies on `instanceof DomainError` (it does not survive serialization). Branch on the transported code instead: `error.data.code` (tRPC). Both halves are enforced: `local/no-client-import-of-server-folder` for the import, `local/no-client-domain-error-instanceof` for the always-false branch.

## Choosing among the five codes

**Prose only**, no rule, for this whole section and for "Telling a refusal from an outage" below: which of the five codes fits a failure, and whether a `catch` is reading the provider's status or the fact that something threw, are semantic judgements no linter makes.

- **A rejected input is `BAD_REQUEST`; an unmet state of the world is `PRECONDITION_FAILED`.** A wrong password, a rejected credential and an invalid or missing reset token are rejected inputs, not missing sessions, so they are `BadRequestError`. A well-formed, permitted request that fails because of something outside the caller's input (an unverified email, a disconnected Installation, a link the user must repair) is `PreconditionFailedError`. `ForbiddenError` stays for permission facts; `UNAUTHORIZED` does not exist, because identity is established at the transport edge before a service runs.
- **A message is never a machine sentinel.** When a client must branch on a case, reserve the transported **code** to that case in the service rather than shipping a marker string: `signInUser` throws `PreconditionFailedError("Verify your email address before signing in.")` for the unverified email and nothing else, so `login-form.client.tsx` can branch on `error.data?.code === "PRECONDITION_FAILED"` to keep offering the resend. A sentinel such as `ForbiddenError("EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED")` fails twice: it leaks a machine token as user copy and it burns a code for nothing.
- **An unreachable branch is dropped, not re-coded under a wrong code.** The "session expired" race (a revocation between the context read and the Better Auth call) gets no new code and no `BadRequestError`. It surfaces as a masked 500 and the next request is refused at the transport edge.
- **Throw your own `DomainError` outside the `try` whose `catch` translates provider messages**, or the catch re-translates it into the wrong copy. The same throw-order discipline preserves branch precedence when several rejections are possible (password before OAuth in `deleteAccount`).
- **Known exception, accepted rather than missed:** `create-invitation.ts`, `accept-invitation.ts` and `reject-invitation.ts` pass Better Auth's own message through as `BadRequestError(error.message)`, so an un-audited upstream string reaches the user. The catch is narrowed to a 4xx `APIError` (from `better-auth/api`): a database failure or a Better Auth 5xx is rethrown untouched and keeps its 500 masking. These sites were inspected and kept; auditing the copy is tracked separately.

## Telling a refusal from an outage

An Integration that fails must not be marked **Reconnect required** for a transient outage (`CONTEXT.md`). Keeping that true is a code discipline, not a property of the error classes:

- **Do work that can fail for _our_ reasons before the `try` whose `catch` decides "the provider refused".** Decrypting a stored refresh token happens first, so a key or payload problem never flips an Installation to **Reconnect required**.
- **The catch discriminates on the provider's status**, not on the fact that something threw: a 4xx carrying `invalid_grant` or `unauthorized_client` is a refusal; anything else is rethrown untouched, writes nothing and emits nothing. A bare `catch {}` silently violates the invariant.
- **The upstream request error stays a plain `Error`** (`JiraRequestError`, `LinearRequestError`, `SlackRequestError`), so an outage keeps its retries.
- **Ordering:** a provider error may only be made non-retriable once refusal and outage are distinguishable. Wrapping first turns a brief provider outage into a permanently failed run and a lost Feedback mirror.
- **Classification coupled to message text is a trap.** `_helpers/slack/match-unhealthy-error.ts` substring-matches `error.message` against `channel_not_found`, `not_in_channel`, `is_archived`, `invalid_auth`, `account_inactive` and `token_revoked`. Rewording a `SlackRequestError` message in `slack-client.ts` turns a permanently broken link into an endless retry, or the reverse. Change the two together.

## The four display channels

Only the query channel carries rules: `local/no-query-status-branch` reports a hand-written status branch, so a query renders through `matchQueryStatus`, and `local/no-restricted-patterns` reports `query.data ?? []` (see [frontend.md](frontend.md)). The rest is **prose only**.

- **Mutations (tRPC mutation / server action): toast.** Read the message from the failed mutation/action and show it via the Sonner toast. The message is already final copy for `DomainError`s, and an `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` arrives pre-masked, so toasting `error.message` never leaks an internal message.
- **Queries (tRPC query): `matchQueryStatus`.** Handle the `Errored` branch declaratively (see [frontend.md](frontend.md)); render `error.message`, never a raw stack.
- **Forms (invalid input): zod field errors.** Validation failures surface as per-field messages from the zod schema, not a toast. tRPC `BAD_REQUEST` with a `ZodError` cause is exposed under `error.data.zodError`.
- **Render crashes and navigation interrupts: route boundaries.** `error.tsx` (render crash), `not-found.tsx` (`notFound()`), `forbidden.tsx` (`forbidden()`), `unauthorized.tsx` (`unauthorized()`). Root `error.tsx` / `global-error.tsx` are the catch-all; a per-shell `error.tsx` exists to render the same screen inside its layout, not to change the copy. An error boundary receives `error` and `retry`.

## Boundary conventions

**Prose only** for this section and for "Logging" below, except the first two points for `error.tsx` and `global-error.tsx`, held by `local/error-boundary-renders-error-screen`. The boundary files are the Next.js special files, exempt from the suffix and default export rules by definition, and what the others render is a judgement about output.

- Every boundary file renders the shared `ErrorScreen` (`@/app/_components/error-screen`) with copy from `@/app/_constants/error-screens` and its actions as children (a retry button, a link out). Do not hand-roll the layout and do not inline the copy: six files use it today (`app/{error,global-error,not-found,forbidden,unauthorized}.tsx` and `app/(authenticated)/error.tsx`, which keeps the sidebar and the header on a dashboard render error).
- A boundary must never render `error.message`: Server Component errors carry a masked digest, and an unexpected message may leak internals. Log the raw error in `useEffect`; show fixed copy to the user. `digest` is not declared in the boundary props type at all (`{ error: Error; retry: () => void }`), so it is unrenderable by construction rather than by discipline.
- **Call `retry()`, not `reset()`.** Next passes `error`, `reset` and `retry`; `retry()` re-fetches and re-renders the boundary's children, where `reset()` only clears the error state.
- **Only the root `error.tsx` and `global-error.tsx` carry the `<main>` landmark**, because an error boundary replaces every nested layout below it. `not-found.tsx`, `forbidden.tsx` and `unauthorized.tsx` must **not**: they render inside the nearest layout, and `admin` and `(authenticated)` already own a `<main>`. A second one would nest.
- **Actions per screen:** `error.tsx` gets `Try again`; `unauthorized.tsx` gets a `Sign in` link (`Button asChild` plus `next/link` to `loginUrl` from `_constants/routes.ts`); not-found and forbidden are copy-only rather than inventing a "Return home" link. No support address is rendered while `SUPPORT_EMAIL` is still a placeholder.
- `global-error.tsx` must declare its own `<html>`/`<body>` and import global styles; it has no metadata export (use a plain `<title>`). It must also declare the two `next/font` families with the `--font-sans` and `--font-mono` variables and the same `next-themes` `ThemeProvider` as the root layout: `globals.css` drives dark mode off the `.dark` class (`@custom-variant dark`), not `prefers-color-scheme`, so without them the screen renders unstyled, and a hand-rolled theme script would be a second implementation. Verifying it needs a browser: the global boundary is a Client Component, so a root-layout failure serves Next's minimal `__next_error__` 500 document and the screen only paints after hydration. `curl` shows the framework shell; check that the response ships the boundary chunk, then look at it in a browser.
- RSC preferred pattern for "missing" stays `find-` (nullable) + explicit `notFound()` in the page. An `interruptOnDomainError` catch-handler, mapping `NotFoundError` to `notFound()` and `ForbiddenError` to `forbidden()`, is the fallback for throws from deeper service calls: write it in `@/server/errors/next-interrupts` with its first caller.
- Route handlers map a thrown `DomainError` with `domainErrorResponse` (`@/server/errors/http-response`) and rethrow when it returns `null`, so a bug keeps its 500. The handler's own transport codes stay at the boundary: a 422 validation failure, a 429 with its headers, a missing scope or a plan limit with its counters is a transport fact, not a domain error.
- **Where a published response differs from what the shared helper would produce, the published response wins and the helper supplies the status only.** An API with clients that cannot be updated writes one scope-local mapper, not one per route: `api/v1/feedback/_helpers/widget-error-response.ts` reuses `domainErrorResponse`'s status map but answers `{ error }` with no `code`, because that is the body widgets already installed on customer sites parse. Same rule for a Tracker webhook: the body a registered webhook already receives is the contract, so Linear and Jira echo the ignore reason and GitHub answers an ignored delivery exactly like an accepted one.

## Logging

- **One `console.error` per failure**, from the exported named function `logTRPCError` (`@/server/trpc/log-trpc-error`) mounted as the tRPC route handler's `onError`. It is a named export rather than an inline arrow so the logged shape is testable through the function tRPC actually calls.
- **Shape:** the prefix `tRPC <type> <path> failed with <code>` (`<unknown path>` when tRPC has none), then the `TRPCError`, then every link of the `cause` chain as a separate argument. **The walk stops on an already-seen cause**, so a self-referencing chain cannot hang a request.
- **Every failure is logged, expected codes included.** Filtering by code was considered and rejected: volume is low, and the expected failure a user reports is the one worth finding. If noise becomes real, the filter belongs in the logging provider.
- `console.error` only. No logger, no monitoring SDK and no `instrumentation.ts`: choosing a provider is a deliberate open decision, not an oversight.

## What masking does not touch

The `errorFormatter` replaces the **message** of an `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` and nothing else. The code, the HTTP status, `data.zodError` and every non-500 message survive. `shape.data.stack` is left alone because tRPC only adds it when `config.isDev`, so it is not a leak to close. Provider wording that used to reach users (`Slack conversations.list failed: invalid_auth`, the Linear pickers) is now the generic sentence **by intent**: those strings name an API method, and the operator reads the original in the server log.

## Anti-patterns

- Never show a raw `error.message`, stack, or `digest` to the user. In `error.tsx` and `global-error.tsx`, enforced by `local/error-boundary-renders-error-screen`; everywhere else **prose only**.
- Never `instanceof DomainError` in client code (`local/no-client-domain-error-instanceof`), or import server error modules into a `.client.tsx` / `"use client"` module (`local/no-client-import-of-server-folder`). The import rule is a boundary rule and cannot be switched off by a disable comment; the `instanceof` rule can, with a written reason.
- Never throw a bare `Error` or a `TRPCError` from a service: `local/services-no-bare-error` reports the first, and the `TRPCError` row of `local/no-cross-layer-import` confines `@trpc/server` to a router and `src/server/trpc/`.
- Never toast a validation error that belongs inline on a form field. **Prose only**, no rule.
- Never add a per-shell `error.tsx` that duplicates `ErrorScreen`'s markup. **Prose only**, no rule.
