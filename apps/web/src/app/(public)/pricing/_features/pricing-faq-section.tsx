    question: "Is there really a free plan?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The Free plan includes 1 project with up to 50 feedback items and is not time-limited. It is designed for solo developers or anyone who wants to try FasterFixes on a real project before committing to a paid plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade or downgrade at any time?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can upgrade directly from your dashboard. Downgrades take effect at the end of your current billing period, so you keep access to your current plan until then.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I cancel?",
    answer:
      "You keep full access to your plan until the end of the current billing period. After that, your account moves to the Free plan. Your data is never deleted.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer annual billing?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Annual billing saves you two months compared to paying monthly, effectively 10 months for the price of 12.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is FasterFixes open source? Can I self-host?",
    answer: `Yes. The full source code is available on GitHub (${GITHUB_REPO_URL}). You can self-host if you prefer to run it on your own infrastructure. The hosted version saves you the setup and maintenance overhead, and includes managed updates and support.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer:
      "We use Stripe for billing. You can pay with any major credit or debit card. All payments are processed securely through Stripe. We never store your card details.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a paid plan for the MCP server or GitHub integration?",
    answer:
      "The MCP server works on all plans, including Free. The GitHub integration, which automatically creates issues from feedback, requires a Pro or Agency plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "What counts as a feedback item?",
    answer:
      "Each time a client submits feedback through the widget, it counts as one feedback item. The Free plan includes up to 50. Pro and Agency plans have unlimited feedback.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does team member pricing work?",
    answer:
      "There are no per-seat charges. Each plan includes a set number of team members: 1 on Free, 5 on Pro, unlimited on Agency. You only pay the flat plan price.",
  },
