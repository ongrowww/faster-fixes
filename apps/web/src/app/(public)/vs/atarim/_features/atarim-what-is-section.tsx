            Atarim (formerly WP Feedback) was founded in 2019 by Vito Peleg in
            London. It is a cloud-based visual collaboration platform used by
            72,000+ teams and 1.7 million users, primarily web design agencies,
            freelancers, and WordPress professionals managing client review
            cycles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The platform centers on point-and-click visual feedback on live
            websites, with a suite of six AI agents called InnerCircle built
            into the dashboard: Pixel (design), Claro (copy), Lexi (SEO), Index
            (UX), Navi (clarity), and Glitch (QA). It supports client portals
            with guest access, whitelabeling, and integrations with Jira, Asana,
            ClickUp, Monday.com, Slack, Trello, Basecamp, Teamwork, Figma,
            Zapier, and more.
          </p>

            Atarim is proprietary, cloud-only, and priced per seat. There is no
            self-hosting option and no public source code. The Pro plan starts
            at $25/seat/month (billed yearly), which means a 5-person team pays
            $125/month, or $1,500/year, before hitting the 5-seat cap and
            upgrading to Business at $35/seat/month.
