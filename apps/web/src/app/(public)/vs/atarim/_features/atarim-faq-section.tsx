FasterFixes ships a widget that installs with a script tag on any site or as a React package, and captures DOM selector, full browser context, and the React component tree on React sites; Atarim uses a JS snippet, Chrome extension, or WordPress plugin with no React SDK and no component tree capture.

    question: "Does FasterFixes have video recording?",

Atarim does not offer video recording either; if video walkthroughs are a hard requirement, BugHerd or Userback include video features.",

    question: "Does Atarim support whitelabeling?",

      "Yes, on the Enterprise plan (custom pricing). Atarim's whitelabel options include custom logo, favicon, color scheme, plugin name, and removal of all Atarim branding. This is one of Atarim's genuine strengths for agencies on Enterprise that deliver a branded client experience. FasterFixes does not currently offer whitelabeling.",
