            This is a direct comparison, not a sales pitch. Usersnap has a
            significantly richer feature set for non-developer use cases.
            FasterFixes and Usersnap solve overlapping problems in meaningfully
            different ways.

              lets non-technical reporters submit feedback on any site without

              integrations are in progress.

            If your workflow centers on product feedback, customer satisfaction,
            NPS tracking, or non-technical client reporting, Usersnap is the
            more complete tool today. FasterFixes is built for a narrower brief,
            and we think it is the right brief for most developer teams shipping
            client websites:

              $20/month for a 5-person team versus $49/month on Usersnap Starter
              ($39/month billed annually). The free plan covers 1 project, 50
              feedback items, and 1 member at no cost. Usersnap offers a trial
              capped at 20 feedback items, not a permanent free tier.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            FasterFixes is a younger product. It does not match Usersnap&apos;s
            survey tooling, integration breadth, or enterprise features. What it
            offers instead is full code ownership, a self-hosted deployment
            path, and a developer workflow no closed-source SaaS can replicate.
