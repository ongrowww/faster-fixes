    question: "How is FasterFixes different from Usersnap?",
    answer:
      "FasterFixes is open-source and self-hostable; Usersnap is closed-source and cloud-only. FasterFixes ships an MCP server so AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) can fetch and resolve feedback from the terminal. Usersnap is a broader platform focused on NPS surveys, microsurveys, and feature request boards. FasterFixes does not currently offer those features. FasterFixes is built specifically for developer teams who need structured bug reports, not product feedback surveys.",

      "@fasterfixes/mcp exposes your open feedback to any MCP-compatible coding agent.

    answer:

Replace the Usersnap snippet with the FasterFixes script tag, or with the React package in a React app. Note that NPS and survey workflows do not migrate. FasterFixes does not support those features.

    answer:
      "The Agency plan costs $99/month and includes unlimited members, unlimited projects, MCP server access, GitHub, Linear, and Jira two-way sync, team kanban, and email support. It is designed for agencies managing multiple client sites from a single workspace at a flat monthly rate.",
