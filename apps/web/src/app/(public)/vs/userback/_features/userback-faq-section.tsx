    question: "How is FasterFixes different from Userback?",
    answer:
      "FasterFixes is open-source and self-hostable; Userback is closed-source and cloud-only. FasterFixes captures DOM selector, URL, browser, and viewport on every report, plus the React component tree on React sites. Userback is a broader platform with annotated video, session replay, NPS surveys, and a feature portal. FasterFixes does not currently offer those features. FasterFixes is built specifically for developer teams who need structured bug reports, not a full product analytics suite.",
