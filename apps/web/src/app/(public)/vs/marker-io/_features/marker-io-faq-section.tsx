    answer:
      "FasterFixes is open-source and self-hostable; Marker.io is closed-source and cloud-only. FasterFixes ships an MCP server so AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) can fetch and resolve feedback from the terminal. Marker.io has no MCP support. Marker.io has the broader feature set today: session replay, Figma/PDF annotation, deep PM integrations, and a client Guest Portal. FasterFixes does not currently match those features.",

A single feedback item can mirror to all three at once, and Jira sync maps by status category rather than status name, so custom workflows need no configuration.
