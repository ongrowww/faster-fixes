            This is a direct comparison, not a sales pitch. FasterFixes and
            Marker.io solve overlapping problems in meaningfully different ways.
            Marker.io is a deeper, more mature product, and it has real
            strengths FasterFixes does not match today:
          </p>

              : bundled on the Team plan and above. FasterFixes has no video
              feedback.

            <li>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Browser extension</strong>:
              Chrome, Firefox, and Safari extensions let reviewers leave
              feedback on any site without touching its code. FasterFixes needs
              its script tag or React package installed on the site.

            If your workflow centers on QA handoffs, client approvals, session
            replay, or design-file annotation, Marker.io is the more complete
            tool today. FasterFixes is built for a narrower brief, and we think
            it is the right brief for most developer teams shipping client
            websites:

          <p>
            FasterFixes is a younger product. It does not match Marker.io&apos;s
            integration breadth, session replay, or client portal. What it
            offers instead is full code ownership, a self-hosted deployment
            path, and a developer workflow no closed-source QA tool can
            replicate.
