A 5-person dev team that needs Jira and devtools already starts at $149/month annual before adding anyone. FasterFixes charges per workspace: $20/month flat for up to 5 members, $99/month for unlimited. Headcount stops being a pricing variable.",

This is the most-cited complaint in FOSS communities; the top result for the keyword is a Reddit thread literally titled “Looking for a self-hosted marker.io alternative.” FasterFixes is open source (dashboard AGPL-3.0, widget MIT) and self-hostable on Next.js, Postgres, Inngest, and R2/S3.",

Those require Team at $149/month annual, a 3.8× jump. FasterFixes does not gate developer-relevant features by tier: GitHub and Linear two-way sync, React component tree capture, and MCP access are available on every plan, including the free one.",

There is no path from client annotation to the editor or terminal. FasterFixes routes feedback to where developers work: GitHub, Linear, and Jira issues via two-way sync, or the terminal via @fasterfixes/mcp, where Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex can read the report and open a fix without leaving the editor.",
