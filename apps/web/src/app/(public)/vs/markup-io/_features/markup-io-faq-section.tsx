    question: "Is there a free Markup.io alternative?",
    answer:
      "Yes. FasterFixes is free to self-host with no member limits, and the hosted Pro plan is $20 a month flat for up to 5 members. The dashboard is AGPL-3.0 and the widget is MIT.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why did Markup.io raise its prices?",
    answer:
      "In January 2025 Markup.io raised Pro from $29 to $79 per month, a 172% increase, and removed the free plan entirely. Customers reported price changes of up to 280% on existing accounts and deletion notices for non-payment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does FasterFixes work without a Chrome extension?",
    answer:
      "Yes. FasterFixes runs as an in-page widget on every device the page supports: desktop, tablet, mobile. No browser extension required, including for auth-gated, localhost, and staging URLs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I self-host a Markup.io alternative?",
    answer:
      "Yes. FasterFixes is the only open-source option in this category. Deploy the AGPL-3.0 dashboard and MIT widget on Vercel, Railway, a VPS, or any infrastructure you control. All feedback data stays inside your environment.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Does FasterFixes work with AI coding agents like Claude Code or Cursor?",
    answer:
      "Yes. FasterFixes ships with a built-in MCP server. Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex can read open feedback, ask follow-up questions, and propose patches without you ever opening the dashboard.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does FasterFixes compare to Markup.io for web agencies?",
    answer:
      "Markup.io is positioned for design review across file types. FasterFixes is built for agencies shipping websites and web apps on any stack where feedback needs to reach a developer or AI agent: DOM selector and React component tree capture, structured sync to GitHub, Linear, and Jira, in-page widget on every device.",
