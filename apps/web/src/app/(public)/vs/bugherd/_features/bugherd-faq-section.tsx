    question: "How is FasterFixes different from BugHerd?",
    answer:
      "Three differences matter most. FasterFixes is open source and self-hostable. Pricing is flat-rate, not per-seat. And the MCP server lets AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) fetch and resolve feedback directly from the terminal. BugHerd is a more mature SaaS with video feedback, Figma/PDF/image feedback, custom branding, SSO, and 20+ project-management integrations. FasterFixes does not currently have those features.",
