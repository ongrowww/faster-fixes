    question: "How does the widget work?",
    answer:
      "Add one script tag to your site, or use the React embed in a React app. Your clients leave feedback in two clicks. The widget captures all the technical context automatically. You review feedback in the dashboard, or your coding agent retrieves it via MCP and fixes it directly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do my clients need an account?",
    answer:
      "No. You generate a shareable link for each client from your dashboard. Anyone with that link can leave feedback. They are authenticated transparently, no signup or login required. It keeps things secure while staying completely frictionless for your clients.",
  },
  {
    question: "What technical context does it capture?",
    answer:
      "Screenshot, page URL, DOM selector, element description, React component tree (when available), browser name and version, viewport dimensions, console logs, network requests, and timestamp. All captured automatically when the client clicks.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the MCP server?",
    answer:
      "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard that lets AI coding agents call external tools. The FasterFixes MCP server exposes your project's feedback to any compatible agent: Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and others. The agent can fetch new feedback and mark items as resolved, all from your terminal.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the GitHub integration work?",
    answer:
      "Connect your GitHub account in the organization settings, then link a repository to your project. New feedback automatically creates a GitHub issue with the full structured report: screenshot, component path, selector, and environment details. Status syncs bidirectionally: closing an issue on GitHub resolves the feedback in FasterFixes, and vice versa. Available on Pro and Agency plans.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this just another annotation tool?",
    answer:
      "Annotation tools make it easier for clients to report bugs. A human still has to read, interpret, and relay that to an AI. FasterFixes removes that step. Feedback is captured as structured technical data and delivered via MCP to an AI coding agent that reads and acts on it directly. The loop is: client reports, agent fixes.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer: `FasterFixes offers a free plan for solo use, a Pro plan at $${PLAN_PRICES["pro"]}/month for freelancers and small teams, and an Agency plan at $${PLAN_PRICES["agency"]}/month for agencies managing many client projects.`,

        <Link href={"/pricing" as Route}>See pricing</Link>
      </Button>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Which frameworks are supported?",
    answer:
      "The widget works on any website: WordPress, Webflow, static HTML, and apps built with React, Next.js, Vue, Nuxt, Angular, Svelte or any other framework. Add it with one script tag, install @fasterfixes/react in a React app, @fasterfixes/vue in a Vue app, @fasterfixes/angular in an Angular app, or @fasterfixes/svelte in a Svelte app. Every embed shares the same widget and captures the same context.",
