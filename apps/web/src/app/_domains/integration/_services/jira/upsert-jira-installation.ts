/**
 * Records the Installation for the Organization, or refreshes the site and the
 * tokens of one already recorded. One Installation per Organization, so
 * reconnecting overwrites the row rather than adding a second one, and Project
 * links survive untouched so sync resumes as it was.
 *
 * Exactly one site is persisted per Organization either way. A grant covering a
 * single site is stored as connected; a grant covering several stores the first
 * as a provisional selection and reports back that the site picker still has to
 * settle it. The picker re-reads the live accessible resources rather than
 * trusting the stored list, so no re-exchange (which would rotate the refresh
 * token) is needed.
 *
 * Tokens are encrypted here rather than by the caller: a route that handled
 * them in clear would be one place too many for them to leak from.
 *
 * `sites` must carry at least one site; a grant that covers none is a refusal
 * the caller answers before recording anything.
