## Approach

- Think before acting. Read existing files before writing code.
- Be concise in output but thorough in reasoning.
- Prefer editing over rewriting whole files.
- Do not re-read files you have already read unless the file may have changed.
- Skip files over 100KB unless explicitly required.
- Suggest running /cost when a session is running long to monitor cache ratio.
- Recommend starting a new session when switching to an unrelated task.
- Test your code before declaring done.
- No sycophantic openers or closing fluff.
- Keep solutions simple and direct.
- User instructions always override this file.

## Non-negotiables

- You are FORBIDDEN from deleting any files yourself.
- If a file must be retired by you: keep an empty `_deprecated_*.ts(x)` replacement with a short comment.
- The user MAY delete files. If a file is already deleted (shows as `deleted` in git status), do NOT restore it — include the deletion as-is in the commit.
- If env vars change, update `.env.example` only.
- Never run a bare `pnpm install` to "refresh" anything. `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed with Prettier's quoting (lint-staged reformats it), and pnpm rewrites it with its own, producing a ~20,000-line diff unrelated to your change. Install only when you are deliberately adding or removing a dependency, and check the lockfile diff before committing.
- Never run production database migrations (`pnpm --filter @workspace/db migrate:prod`).
- Only run development migrations (`pnpm --filter @workspace/db migrate:dev`); production migration execution is user-managed.
- Code identifiers, comments, filenames, schemas: English only.
- User-facing UI copy: English only. Professional, clear, and concise — match the tone of serious developer tools (e.g., Vercel, Linear, Stripe). No marketing fluff, no casual language, no exclamation marks. Prefer precise, understated wording.
- Never use the em dash character (`—`) in user-facing text. Use a comma, colon, or period instead.

## Code comments

- Add inline comments only when the logic is not self-evident — complex conditions, non-obvious side effects, tricky workarounds, or subtle business rules.
- Never comment what the code plainly says (e.g. no `// get user` above `getUser()`).
- Prefer a short inline `// why` over a multi-line block above a function.

## Critical conventions

All coding standards for this project live in the `coding-standards` skill at `.claude/skills/coding-standards/`.

**Load that skill** before writing code, reviewing changes, or answering questions about conventions.

- Use canonical domain terms defined in `CONTEXT.md`.

## Required checks before done

- Work is done only when these pass, whether or not you commit:
  - `sh .husky/pre-commit` from the repo root. The hook is the single list of checks, so read it rather than restating it. Typecheck, tests and Knip read the whole working tree, so unstaged work can fail the hook too.
  - `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format:check`. The hook's lint-staged step covers staged files only; these cover every workspace, so they catch a file your change broke without touching it. Every lint rule is at `error` with zero warnings tolerated, so any report is a regression.
- **On a fresh clone, generate before you lint.** The Prisma client, the published package builds and the Next.js route types are all untracked. `pnpm typecheck` generates them itself (the task depends on `^build`, and the web script runs `next typegen` first), but the type-aware lint rules report errors unrelated to your change until you have run `pnpm build:packages`, `pnpm --filter @workspace/db db:gen` and `pnpm --filter web exec next typegen`.
- If DB schema changed: run `pnpm --filter @workspace/db migrate:dev`, then `pnpm --filter @workspace/db db:gen`.
- A production build is `pnpm --filter web build` from the repo root, not `pnpm build` inside `apps/web`: the filter is what resolves the workspace packages. Note that `apps/web/src/app/_domains/integration/_services/github/github-app.ts` reads `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` at module evaluation, so page-data collection for `/api/github/setup` fails without a value in the environment.

## Keep costs low

- Reuse existing patterns in touched folders.
- Keep edits scoped to the task.
- Prefer enforceable rules in lint/CI/hooks over prompt text.

## Subagent Strategy

- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues at `manucoffin/faster-fixes`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default canonical vocabulary (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Releasing packages

`@fasterfixes/*` packages are published by CI from `main` through Changesets. Use the `release` skill to write the changeset; CI is the only publisher.

### Domain docs

Single-context repo. Glossary at `CONTEXT.md`; ADRs in `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Next.js

`apps/web` runs a Next.js version with breaking changes against your training data. Before writing Next.js code, read the relevant guide in `apps/web/node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (see `apps/web/AGENTS.md`).
